# SQLiteApp
This app uses an SQLite database to store and update values in the form of ID, Name (First Name), Surname (Last Name), and Marks (Grade).  You can add data by inputting the first and last names, as well as grade.  From there, you can view the data using a button.  You can also update information in a listing by typing information in all fields and specifying the ID number of the entry that you want to update.  Similarly, you can delete an entry by simply inputting the ID number of the entry you want deleted.  When each entry is added, a new ID number is automatically formed.  You cannot go back and re-use an ID number that has been deleted.
